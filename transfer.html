            <h3> Transfer Credit </h3>
            <p> Washington University awards academic credit for course work that resembles, by official description, a comparable course offering from one of its five undergraduate schools. No credit is given for CLEP exams, standard-level IB exams, correspondence/online courses, or departmental placement exams given by another institution. Credit is awarded if grades of C or better appear on your transcript. </p>
